ASSIGNMENT DAY 2

Problem 1

Create a detailed pseudocode for the program that takes a number as input, calculates the square if it's even, or the cube if it's odd,
and then outputs the result. We'll incorporate conditional and looping constructors.

Pseudocode:

1.Take input as y,sq
2.if(y%2==0)
3.print the given number is even
4.for(i=0;i<=10;i++)
5.sq=y*y
6.print the square of the number
7.else
8.print the given number is odd
9.for(i=0;i<=10;i++)
10.qu=y*y*y
11.print the qube of the number.
