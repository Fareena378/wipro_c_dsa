Problem 1


LINEAR SEARCH


pseudocode for linear search 

input list of array as list(arr)={23, 56, 67,78}
input search element as x
for i=0 to n-1 (i=o, i<=n-1, i++)
if arr[i]==x
return i
repeat the loop 
return -1

Explanation:

Linear search is used to search the element in the list of array. It visit each element starting from one by one, while standing each element 
compare with searched element. If the search element is found it will return the position. If it is not found it will return some bogus or 
non-used position.
Speed of algorithm = Time of complexity = 0(N).
For large dataset linear search is not very efficient.
For small datasets it is perfect.
It is very simple to implement in C.
It works on Unsorted list.
