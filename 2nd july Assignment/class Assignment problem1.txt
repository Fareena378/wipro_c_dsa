problem1:
Create a C program to define similar type of structure and union.
For e.g.
struct person
{
  char name[50];
  int aadhaarCard;
  float salary;
  char gender;
};
union person
{
  char name[50];
  int aadhaarCard;
  float salary;
  char gender;
};
Compare their sizes in C program using 'sizeof' operator in C.

code:

#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
struct person1 
{
  char name[50];
  int aadhaarCard;
  float salary;
  char gender;
}s;
union person2 
{
  char name[50];
  int aadhaarCard;
  float salary;
  char gender;
}u;
printf("size of structure is %ld\n",sizeof(s));//here %ld used for long insigned int
printf("size of union is %ld",sizeof(u));//here %ld used for long insigned int
return 0;
}   

output:
size of structure is 64
size of union is 52

** Process exited - Return Code: 0 **
