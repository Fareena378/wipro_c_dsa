Class Assignment Day6:
problem 2:
Write a c program which will double the value of the normal variable inside user defined function named 'Double1()'and 'Double2()' will be use pass by value and 
Double,will use the pass by referance(pointers).After calling the Double1()and Double2() print the value of the variable inside the main().

code:

#include <stdio.h>

void Double1(int x) {
    x = x * 2;
}
 
void Double2(int *x) {
    *x = *x * 2;
}
 
int main() {
    int x = 30; // Initial value of x
    printf("Original value of x: %d\n", x);
    // Call Double1() (pass by value)
    Double1(x);
    printf("Value of x after Double1(): %d\n", x); // x remains unchanged
    // Call Double2() (pass by reference)
    Double2(&x);
    printf("Value of x after Double2(): %d\n", x); // x is doubled
    return 0;
}

output:

Original value of x: 30
Value of x after Double1(): 30
Value of x after Double2(): 60


** Process exited - Return Code: 0 **
